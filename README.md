# README

My name is Jeffrey Osterlie Adjei. I am a Ruby on Rails developer.

This is my first project learning HTML5, CSS, Javascript, Jquery, etc.

I am excited to learn more tech stuff. This is a learning experience.

I am really looking forward to doing some computer magic as Hartl would say.

I believe that this will go a long way to help me build a solid IT business.
